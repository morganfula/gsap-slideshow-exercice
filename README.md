Hello future developers! 👋 Welcome to our educational development project. This is where you'll apply the knowledge gained from lectures and embark on some real-world coding adventures. 

## Objectives 🎯

Here are the challenges you'll be tackling:

1. 👨‍💻 Recreate the live demo by yourself.
2. 📱 Make the project responsive, ensuring it looks great on any device.
3. 🎠 Add a carousel header using the powerful animation library, GSAP.
4. 🔄 Refactor the code to optimize it, particularly when dealing with multiple sections.
5. 🚀 As a stretch goal, try to recreate the advanced version of the website.

## Resources 📖

To aid you on this journey, here are some important resources:
