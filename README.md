# Development Project Guidelines 📚

Hello future developers! 👋 Welcome to our educational development project. This is where you'll apply the knowledge gained from lectures and embark on some real-world coding adventures. 

## Objectives 🎯

Here are the challenges you'll be tackling:

1. 👨‍💻 Recreate the live demo by yourself.
2. 📱 Make the project responsive, ensuring it looks great on any device.
3. 🎠 Add a carousel header using the powerful animation library, GSAP.
4. 🔄 Refactor the code to optimize it, particularly when dealing with multiple sections.
5. 🚀 As a stretch goal, try to recreate the advanced version of the website.

## Resources 📖

To aid you on this journey, here are some important resources:

- 🎥 [Lecture](https://www.notion.so/GSAP-Slideshow-8da85170189c457bb1ed754677fa0335?pvs=4): Your theoretical foundation.
- 💻 [Live Demo](https://gsap-slideshow.netlify.app/): The practical blueprint you'll be recreating.
- 🏞️ [Advanced Version](https://gsap-slideshow-advanced.netlify.app/): The next level to aspire to.
- 🌟 [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/): A tool for creating high-performance animations.
- 🖼️ [Imageloaded](https://imagesloaded.desandro.com/): A library to help manage your images.

## Instructions 📝

1. 🕵️ **Redo the live demo**: Understand and recreate the live demo independently. This is where you'll apply your understanding of the fundamental concepts.
2. 🔍 **Make it responsive**: Adapt your website to different device sizes for a seamless user experience.
3. 🎨 **Add a carousel header using GSAP**: Enrich your website with an interactive carousel header.
4. 💡 **Refactor the code for multiple sections**: Should your website have multiple sections, ensure your code is efficient and clean by refactoring.
5. 🎢 **Redo the advanced version**: For those who enjoy an extra challenge, try recreating the advanced version of the website. 

Remember, this is a learning journey. Don't hesitate to ask questions, collaborate with others, and share your learning. Happy coding! 🚀
